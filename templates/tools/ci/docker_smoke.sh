#
# Starts ONE game container plus one player container per seat on a shared
# user-defined docker network, driving them with the certification fixture out
# of coworld_manifest_template.json (same seat mix the certifier will use), and
# asserts the game exits 0 having written results.json and a replay.
#
# It is the containerised twin of the local tmp/run_e2e.sh: same COGAME_*
# contract, same one-player-process-per-slot shape, but every process runs in
# the production image so a broken entrypoint or a missing runtime library
# fails here instead of in hosted certification.
